Document Similarity
==============

The task was to compute document similarity and represent semantic information using Vector Space Models.
--------------

The various semantic features used for the representation of vectors are Term Frequency (TF), Term Frequency. Inverse Document Frequency (TF.IDF), Mutual Information (MI). we will also compare binary representations, tf.idf weights and
mutual information for determining the coordinates of an object. We will perform a simple evaluation to compare to what extent the different choices lead to different solutions and to decide which solution is best.
Another approach was to use a cluster of similar words represenation.
