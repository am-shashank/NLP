Document Classifier
===================

Focus was on developing a supervised classifier for identifying information-dense news texts, which report important factual information in direct, succinct manner. develop a supervised classifier for the information-dense/non-informative distinction. The main focus is on feature engineering. The challenge was to come up with features that distinguish between the
two types of text.

We used a combination of several lexical and syntactic features. Please look into the PDF for more detailed information.
